csj-html-basic-markup
=====================

Welcome to the Basic Markup project from CSJ: Introduction to Web Development.

In this project you will mark up a document based on the decision from
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren in the 1954 *Brown v. Board of Education*
case that made segregated schools illegal in the United States. This is a
landmark decision, and heartening to read, but we are not focusing so much on
the words as the structure.

The goal of this assignment is to practice marking up documents. You will be
expected to use a set of common tags:

* document tags (html, head, body, meta, link, script)
* headings (h1...h6)
* paragraphs (p)
* links (a)
* lists (ul, li)
* images (img)
* text formatting (b, i, sup, sub)
